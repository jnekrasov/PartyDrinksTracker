# PartyDrinksTracker
Simple and fun project using Swift to track you alcohol consumptions (like beer, wine, shots and cigarettes) during the parties or night-outs.

I used it myself :) It was create as exercise to learn a bit Swift and iOS development basics (my main languages is C#) during my spare time. Feel free to review the codebase and point me my mistakes or contribute.

The app is published on Apple AppStore and is completelly open-sourced :)
